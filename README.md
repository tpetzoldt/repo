## wasm-repo

This is a repo of self-compiled packages for testing with [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/) (R in the web browser), especially of packages that are not yet availalble from https://repo.r-wasm.org/

Note that some of the packages still produce runtime errors and cannot be used in practice.
